# What is this?

TL;DR There's nothing of interest to see here.

I'm slowly re-building a subset of mame with 2 mail goals:
  1. To understand the mame codebase better
  2. To gain some experience in CI tools such as Travis

Please feel free to look around, make a clone etc. Don't however expect the codebase to work or do anything useful.
